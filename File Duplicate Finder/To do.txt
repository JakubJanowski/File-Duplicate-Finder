Bugs:
	scroll propagate down to main list
	switch visibility for tabitems after pressing find duplicates button not the checkbox for primaryonly
	clicking on buttons does not always work in listview when it is being constantly updated
	buttons on hover flicker on refresh
	scroll doesn't adjust size to listitem height but to listitemcount   VirtualizingPanel.ScrollUnit="Item" or pixel
	when deleting from appdata with noadmin rights it did nothing not even logged errors
	checkbox remove from list when only one element left whit no other to compare to (do not delete elements from list after ignoring other for sure
	 add watermark text after removing files from list because they don't have a duplicate saying something like "Files that did not have a duplicate after your operation were removed from this list" OR gray out the name of alone file
	do something with hiding list elements on remove all, the <= 1 is bad as default as it's scary to see all elements disappear, maybe add an information, make them collapse into subgroup or make a checkbox to make it an opitonal feature
	don't always steal focus with logs
	make 'remove all' buttons and similiar enabled only after first search has completed 
	Notification blinking tab on log when new entry has been added instead of switching focus to it
	ask when deleting large files without backup misguides when pressing remove all button always asks for confirmation (besides it being a different feature)
	inconsistent normalize path when given: D:\ the paths in results don't start with \, but when a path like D:\Something\ is given, the last \ is truncated and results start with \

Refactoring:
	change GetFileLength() < 0 with other wrapping function
	GetTempPath and GetTempFileName() instead of "tmp/"

Features:
	group files together if whole folders contain the same content and mark it somehow
	setting to match only files with the same names and/or content  + it could be marked somehow when not checked and eg. files will be grouped in the same folder but with different names
	recognize identical subpath
	ignore group
	show file size checkbox
	show number of results or some other statistics
	remove/ignore/show in explorer on restore list
	look at files in archives too
	show files with match percentage above given treshold
	regex search names (add tooltip because it's hard to use - "If you want to search for files with some extension write *.jpg, see full guide online link")
	show progress on taskbar icon / make a notification sound when finished?
	show estimated reamining time m minutes, s seconds remaining
	let user choose between size unit B, KiB, Mib... or B, kB, MB
	add searchbar for filename
	 search by directory tree visual structure
	add setting for recursive search (default on)
	add settings column animate sliding it on top of everything from the right after clicking on gear icon
	Use some theme
	clear log button
	sort buttons above columns with path and size instead of radiobuttons
	after stopping change view to found duplicates tab
	config file with ignored directories in search and maybe open last checked
	Sort alphabetically all filepaths and upon expanding them show other files that have the same content (someone might search for a particular file)
	dont store names as guids but as normal name but make sure the names don't collide easiest way - add id at the end, can use some static number and eventually store it in application state

Optimise:
	CHeck profiler
	Show full path only for displayed not for every file 
	check icon code for optimisations
	?hold absolute path, relative path and base path in fileentry?
	use hash sets or store Ids instead of just lists of tuples of strings (performance penatly when searching for a filepath in list during removal, etc.)

Tests:
	check folder icon code
	test primary only Touro/backup/kuba janowski old and remove file from duplicated list

Consider:
	asking for admin rights when needed
